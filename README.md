If you have not already used this application in your browser, enter a city name in the input box in the 
middle of the screen, and click on the Search button.  Weather data for your entered city will appear to
the right.  This city name will also be stored in local storage and appear as a button the next time you 
use the application.  This applicatoin shows up to the last 8 cities you seached for as search buttons 
below the input box and first search button.  If you wish to see the weather for any of your last 8 city 
searches, just click on the button with that city name.  If you press the Search button but did not 
enter a city name in the input box, you see a message asking you to enter a city name.
