// https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. 
//use another API to call the weather api - fetch is an api
//console.log is also an api.  document object is an api. can see this in official JS documentation.
//MDN web docs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#examples
//use this one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
//fetch().then().then().catch()
//built in functions are called methods. fetch is a method.  It accepts a url or an api endpoint and makes a request to that.
//when it makes a request, 
// function test(){
// }
// test();  //takes much less time (less than 1ms) 
//there's a chance there could be a delay when making the call to the API on another server
//that can take some time to come back. fetch runs this call in the background and we don't want to wait too long.
//even 3 seconds is too long.  returns a promise in the background. 2 conditions.  get data or do not get data. resolve or reject.
//catch automatically knows if the return is not ok.  Look at network tab in inspect in google dev tools.  status return code 200 means ok.  
//Anything other than 200 is NOT ok.  Fetch is not the only way to make the request. Could use XMLHTTPRequest and axios.
//JSON() is a method that the web understands and converts data to a readable, understandable format, which is JSON format
//we don't need to export this to a json file because the "then((data" line stores that data in its JSON format.  data is an object passed to the
//method so we can process it.
//Installed extension Live Server in VS code so we do not have to refresh the browser after making changes in vs code 
//To check if the code works,"open with live server" and then do inspect in dev tools and go to console tab.  This still didn't allow us to bypass.
//if Origin & CORS Changer  www.moesif.com.  Chrome extension installed.  Allows us to make cross domain request.
//only use curly braces in lat, lon and appid below if it's a variable
//favicon is the icon that's in the browser tab 
//when look at weather data returned, 8 rows for each dates (look at dev tools - console and expand second row arrow)
//live share extension is a tool that allows another person to collaborate on your project at the same time
//fetch is a method (built-in function) in JS.  Fetch is also an API. .  API stands for application programming interface.
//making a request using lat and long in this api call using fetch
//api endpoint https is called the api endpoint
//open weather map is a server that has multiple api endspoint.  The line below for the weather is just one of them.
//.then is a method that runs a callback function inside of it
//asdfasfd.addEventListener("click",startButton) - example of callback function, which here is startButton
//making request to endpoint then making callback function to do next
//fetch returns a promise, handle promise in then
//promise has 3 states: fulfilled (got data), rejected (error like 404), pending (still not filfilled or rejected) 
//fetch lat and log from a different openweather map website to pass to the weather api
//if the return status in networks tab in dev tools is ok, it's 200 or 204 etc.  If not ok, catch takes over which 
//might be a 404 or 500.
//what is response below? it's a parameter - we can name it anything
//"(response) => response.json()" is a callback function run by .then 
//response holds non-readable data (only done when ok). then next line below starting with "let data" puts data
//in json file and it's readable
//first .then resolves the first promise which was returned from the fetch.
//second .then resolves the second promise that we got from applying the json method on the response. 
//each promise needs a .then
//if more promises, more .then
//drilling object 
//data below is the promise
//first we use the geocoding API to get the lat and long of the city entered, then we use the lat and lon values 
//to get the weather forecast with the forecast API
//below we have to use variables and return the variable but arrow function shorthand we don't have to do that
